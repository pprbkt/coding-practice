# C++ Basics - Day 1

## What I Learned Today

- Basic program structure (`main()`, `#include <iostream>`)
- Output with `std::cout` and `std::endl` / `\n`
- Variables & assignment
- Main data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `std::string`
- Constants with `const`
- Namespaces (`namespace`, `::`, `using` directive)
- Scope resolution operator `::`
- Comments (`//` and `/* */`)

## Why Learn C++?

- Very fast performance
- Powers game engines, graphics, video games
- Widely used in embedded systems
- Middle-level language (close to hardware, good control)
